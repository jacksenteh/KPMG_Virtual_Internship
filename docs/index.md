title: KPMG Virtual Internship

# Introduction
The KPMG virtual intenship is an online program where a user can learn first-hand how does a data scientist anaysis and provide insight on the customer's dataset in an end-to-end fashion. It is a good practice for anyone who want to persuit a data scientist role. This is due to the fact that, this exercise requires you to perform data quality analysis, data exploration, machine learning models development, models interpretation and summarize the result to the customer.

In practice, a data scientist needs to understand the data better than anyone else (including the customer). This indicates data scientists needs to carry out all the tasks mentioned above (or more) so that they can tell "stories" based on the data! While all the data science course online did a great job on providing knowledge on the Machine Learning/AI models (which is one of the essential skiils on becoming a successful data scientist), it is far from just developing and fine-tunning the ML/AI models. Hence, in my point of view, I think it is a good practice to participate on these virtual internships or Kaggle to understand what is the data scientist job in real life!

Ok, enough talking. Let's get started!

# Aims and Objectives
The aim of the project is to help a bike accessories company, Sprocket Central Pty Ltd, to target new customer is Australia.
To achieve this aim, the customer has provided three dataset for KPMG. The dataset are as follow:
* CustomerDemographics
* CustomerAddress
* Transaction

Based on the three dataset, you were asked to complete the following three tasks and submitted to the website for evaluation:
1. **Data Quality Analysis:** In this task, you were asked to analysis the quality of the dataset provided by the customer by identifying all the issues. Subsequently, you need to send an email to the customer summarizing the issues found.
2. **Data Exploration:** Explore and understanding the data distribution (i.e., customer personality, behaviours, etc.).
3. **Data Pre-processing:** Data cleaning, data transformation and features engineering. 
4. **Model Development:** Determine and development machine learning models.
5. **Result Interpretation:** Creating a powerpoint presentation which outlines the approaches you take for the data exploration, pre-processing and model development. 

Every tasks listed had to be approved by the customer before proceeding to the next stage. Hence a detailed explanation are required. 
So if you decide to use a deep neural network to analysis the customer behaviour, make sure you can explain it to the customer...    

***Please note that, the data scientist in KPMG might not reply or communicate with you during the process. A model answer will be provided on each stage and you have to conduct a self-assessment by comparing your's to the model answer.***

### There's a horizontal rule below this.

### Here is an unordered list:

*   Item foo
*   Item bar
*   Item baz
*   Item zip

### And an ordered list:

1.  Item one
1.  Item two
1.  Item three
1.  Item four

### And a nested list:

- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
    - level 3 item
    - level 3 item
- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
- level 1 item

### Definition lists can be used with HTML syntax.

Long, single-line code blocks should not wrap. They should horizontally scroll if they are too long. This line should be long enough to demonstrate this.
